        <p>At Travel&co, travel isn't just about the destination — it's about the people you meet, the moments you collect, and the stories you bring back.

            We're Inès and Apolline, two passionate travelers and longtime friends who turned our shared love of exploration into a travel agency built on heart, experience, and curiosity. After years of backpacking, planning dream getaways for friends, and diving deep into the cultures we visited, we created Travel&co to offer something different: personalized, meaningful travel experiences that are as unique as you are.
            
            Whether you're looking for a serene escape, an adrenaline-filled adventure, or an off-the-beaten-path cultural immersion, we're here to make it happen — with authenticity, care, and a whole lot of wanderlust.
            
            Let's dream together and plan your next unforgettable journey 🌞✈️ We look forward to seeing you again soon!</p>

            <p>
              After 10 years working in investment banking, I decided to change my career and built my own boutique Travel Agency. I spent time across the world discovering the rare gems and meeting incredible partners to offer outstanding experiences off the beaten path.
              <br><br>
              From this point forward, I combine my passion for travel and my expertize in project management and events for high-end customers who want to experience authentic and unique adventures, always with a bespoke treat. If you recognize yourself in this description, just get in touch.
              <br><br>
              See you soon!<br>
